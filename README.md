# Machine-Learning-ML-
Basic ML algorithm implementation in python

**Intitution :**

Thnik about a ball that rolling down from a hill, what will be it's behaviour?

It will take the lowest path until  it comes to the lowest point of the hill that is the palne

# picture

**Gradient decent** also works like this it starts from a point(Starting point) and take the path that have lower gradient 

# picture 

Now the question is how it will determine what will be it's Step size and how it will determine ....it have reached to it's goal

so the algo introduced **learning rate(ª)** it will  give the step size 
and to converge the algo **Precision** and **Max Iteration** is given 

# pic

**Note :** don't use too small learing rate then it will converge too slowly or if you use too large L.R  then there is a chance it will not converge at all

# Process :

**Step 1 :** Initialize <math>x =7.</math> of fuction<math> y=x^2</math> Then, find the gradient of the function,<math> dy/dx = 2*x.</math>

**Step 2 :** Move in the direction of the lower of the gradient . **But wait,** how much to move? For that, we require a learning rate. 
Let us assume the learning rate → 0.2

**Step 3** After  every iteration (after moving each step) check whether it reaches to local minimum or not
